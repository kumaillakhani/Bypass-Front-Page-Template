Bypass Front Page Template
==========================

A small WordPress plugin to disable the front-page.php template in the Wordpress theme from
itlogics.net without modifying the theme.

This allows you to set a static page as the homepage, while keeping the sidebar and page
title. The page.php template will be used instead.

Because this is a plugin, the modification will survive theme updates.

Installation: Download the repo, and upload to your site.
